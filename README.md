# Viens et al. (2018, accepted in Journal of Geophysical Research - Solid Earth)
This repository contains Python functions for [Viens et al. (2018, JGR)](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1029/2018JB015697).
The single station cross-correlation (SC) functions for all the MeSO-net stations between February 20, 2011 to May 11, 2011 can be downloaded at: https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/TPDPHA

Files:
- The Get_SC_functions.py function is to compute single-station cross-correlation (SC) functions.
- The Stretching.py file contains a function to perform the stretching to obtain the dv/v 
- The Get_dv_v_example.py file is to perform the stretching and plot the results (first need to download the data).
